# You Need to Be Added to @gammatech npm Org First

## 🚫 Why You Can't Create the Token

You're not a member of the **@gammatech** npm organization yet, so it doesn't appear in your dropdown.

---

## ✅ What Your CTO Needs to Do

Send him this message:

> "Hey! I need to be added to the @gammatech npm organization so I can publish the n8n package.
> 
> Can you run this command?
> 
> `npm org add gammatech YOUR_NPM_USERNAME --role developer`
> 
> Once I'm added, I can create a token and publish **@gammatech/n8n-nodes**."

---

## 🔍 What He'll Do

```bash
# He logs into npm with org owner/admin access
npm login

# Adds you to the org
npm org add gammatech YOUR_NPM_USERNAME --role developer
```

**Replace `YOUR_NPM_USERNAME` with your actual npm username**

---

## ✅ After He Adds You

1. Refresh the npm tokens page
2. Create new granular token
3. **@gammatech will now appear** in the organizations dropdown!
4. Select it, set "Read and write"
5. Generate token
6. Publish!

---

## 📝 Simpler Alternative

**He can also:**
1. Create the token himself (as an owner)
2. Give you the token
3. You use it to publish

But adding you to the org is better long-term!

**tl;dr: You're not in @gammatech org yet. Ask CTO to add you!**
